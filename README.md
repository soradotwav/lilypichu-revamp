# LilyPichu Light Revamp
This theme is using most of the assets, the original creator, [Nyria](https://github.com/NYRI4/LilyPichu), made. 

Please support him and his work as it was the base of this revamp.
## Changes
As of version 1.2, I've added some layout improvements e.g. adding the member list to the right module on the Stage tab, as well as changing the colors of multiple menus and objects to make them fit more into the overall color scheme.

It is important to mention that this theme is Lightmode only as of this writing and I took out most of the functionality in Darkmode, so please keep that in mind when using it. I may make a version for Darkmode in the future but this is not planned yet.

## Installation

To install the theme first download and install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/). After installing it, download the theme file by pressing the "Code" button above and selecting "Download ZIP" in the dropdown menu.

Unzip the file you downloaded, relaunch Discord, and head into the settings. Scroll down until you see the ["Themes" tab](https://i.ibb.co/3Yf1MZc/Screenshot-784.png) and click on it. Click on the "Open theme folder" button and just drag and drop the "lilypichuEdit.theme.css" file from the zip you've downloaded into the folder that opened. 

Lastly, just press the slider, seen below in the top right corner of the image, on the new module that was added into your themes tab and the theme should be enabled!
